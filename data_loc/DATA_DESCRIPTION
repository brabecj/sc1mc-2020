The data in the directory transition_metals/ in the subset of the SC1MC-2020 database. It comprises 
complexes with piridine ligands. Active spaces of hexameres with more than three pyridines have been 
extended to 46 orbitals by extension of the virtual part, since otherwise the virtual space was too small.

The data in the directory heterocyclic/ includes a number of heterocyclic organic molecules with less than 
11 non-hydrogen atoms computed with DFT using B3LYP functional.

The orbitals within active spaces have been localized with Foster-Boys procedure, separately for
occupied and virtual parts. Single- and two-orbital entropies have been recalculated for the new localized 
spaces with the bond dimension 1024.
